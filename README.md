# WebGL-Cube-Motion-Interactive-3D-Animation
The project is focused on utilizing WebGL technology to create a dynamic rotating cube with translation, scaling, and interactive features. The cube will be programmed to rotate continuously while also allowing users to move it left and right. Additionally, users can control the scaling of the cube, enabling zoom in and out functionality.
